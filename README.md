# Transparency regarding Thunderbird in the Microsoft Store, via Store Ports.
You've asked for transparency. We've got it! This repository is for the Thunderbird port project to the Microsoft Store via Store Ports. 

Thunderbird for Windows 10 devices via the Microsoft Store is compiled using a three-step conversion process:
  1. Non-administrative install is invoked on default Thunderbird .exe installer.
  2. Non-administrative installed program, along with all it's compenents and files are exported to a sandboxed workspace using the Microsoft Desktop App Converter.
  3. Converted/Exported non-administrative installation is archived into a .AppX package to be uploaded to the Microsoft Store.
  
In addition, every release in the Microsoft Store is verified for authenticity, security, and quality by Microsoft before being published.

Enjoy Thunderbird on your Windows 10 devices, all without turning S-Mode off!
